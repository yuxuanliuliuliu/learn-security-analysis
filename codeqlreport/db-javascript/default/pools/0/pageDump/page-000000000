* Note that some functions use different return types depending on the number
of parameters passed in. In these cases, you may need to annotate the type
of the result in your code, so the JSCompiler understands which type you're
expecting. For example:
<code>var elt = /** @type {Element} * / (foo.get(0));</code>
